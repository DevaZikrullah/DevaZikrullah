### 🏢 ERP & Odoo Expertise

I’ve worked extensively with Odoo ERP, both on the **technical** and **functional** sides, covering:  

- **Sales & CRM** – Managing the full sales cycle from leads to invoices, implementing pricing strategies, and tracking customer relationships.  
- **Inventory & Purchasing** – Handling multi-warehouse operations, stock transfers, automated reordering, and vendor management.  
- **Accounting & Finance** – Setting up invoicing, payment flows, bank reconciliation, and generating financial reports.  
- **HR & Payroll** – Managing employee data, attendance, leave requests, and payroll processing.  
- **Manufacturing & MRP** – Creating bills of materials, scheduling production, and monitoring work orders.  
- **Point of Sale (POS)** – Configuring multi-branch POS systems, integrating payments, and managing product catalogs.  
- **Project Management** – Organizing tasks, tracking time, and monitoring project progress.  

💡 In most of these modules, I’ve handled **customization, integration with APIs, and workflow optimization** to match unique business needs.
